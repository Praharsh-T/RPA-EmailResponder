Email Auto-Responder System
The Email Auto-Responder System automates the process of responding to incoming emails based on predefined keywords and responses. The system connects to a Gmail account, retrieves unread emails, and checks their subject and body for specific keywords. Using a keyword-response mapping stored in an Excel file, the system sends appropriate responses to the email senders. The solution is designed to streamline email handling and ensure timely and consistent replies.
